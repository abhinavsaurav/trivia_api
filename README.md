### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. The endpoints are used to supply the data from the server to the frontend. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
